				<description>MII busy This register field can be read by the application (Read), can be set to 1 by the application with a register write of 1 (Write Set), and is cleared to 0 by the core (Self Clear). The application cannot clear this type of field, and a register write of 0 to this bit has no effect on this field.  This bit should read a logic 0 before writing to this register and the MAC_MII_DATA register. This bit must also be set to 0 during a Write to this register. During a PHY register access, this bit will be set to 1 by the Application to indicate that a Read or Write access is in progress. The MAC_MII_DATA register should be kept valid until this bit is cleared by the MAC during a PHY Write operation. The MAC_MII_DATA register is invalid until this bit is cleared by the MAC during a PHY Read operation. This register should not be written to until this bit is cleared.</description>

				<description>CSR clock range The CSR Clock Range selection determines the frequency of the MDC clock. The suggested range of CLK_M3_ETHERNET frequency applicable for each value below (when Bit[5] = 0) ensures that the MDC clock is approximately between the frequency range 1.0 MHz - 2.5 MHz.  When bit 5 is set, you can achieve MDC clock of frequency higher than the IEEE 802.3 specified frequency limit of 2.5 MHz and program a clock divider of lower value. For example, when CLK_M3_ETHERNET is of frequency 100 MHz and you program these bits as 1010, then the resultant MDC clock will be of 12.5 MHz which is outside the limit of IEEE 802.3 specified range. Program the values given below only if the interfacing chips supports faster MDC clocks.  See Table 554 for bit values.</description>

				<description>Flow Control Busy/Backpressure Activate  This register field can be read by the application (Read), can be set to 1 by the application with a register write of 1 (Write Set), and is cleared to 0 by the core (Self Clear). The application cannot clear this type of field, and a register write of 0 to this bit has no effect on this field.  This bit initiates a Pause Control frame in Full-Duplex mode. In Full-Duplex mode, this bit should be read as 0 before writing to the Flow Control register. To initiate a Pause control frame, the Application must set this bit to 1. During a transfer of the Control Frame, this bit will continue to be set to signify that a frame transmission is in progress. After the completion of Pause control frame transmission, the MAC will reset this bit to 0. The Flow Control register should not be written to until this bit is cleared. In Half-Duplex mode, when this bit is set (and TFE is set), then backpressure is asserted by the MAC Core. During backpressure, when the MAC receives a new frame, the transmitter starts sending a JAM pattern resulting in a collision. This control register bit is logically ORed with the flow controller input signal for the backpressure function. When the MAC is configured to Full- Duplex mode, the BPA is automatically disabled.</description>

				<description>Transmit Flow Control Enable  In Full-Duplex mode, when this bit is set, the MAC enables the flow control operation to transmit Pause frames. When this bit is reset, the flow control operation in the MAC is disabled, and the MAC will not transmit any Pause frames. In Half-Duplex mode, when this bit is set, the MAC enables the back-pressure operation. When this bit is reset, the backpressure feature is disabled.</description>

				<description>Pause Low Threshold  This field configures the threshold of the PAUSE timer at which the input flow control is checked for automatic retransmission of PAUSE Frame. The threshold values should be always less than the Pause Time configured in Bits[31:16]. For example, if PT = 0x100 (256 slot-times), and PLT = 01, then a second PAUSE frame is automatically transmitted if the flow control signal is asserted at 228 (256 - 28) slot-times after the first PAUSE frame is transmitted.</description>

				<description>VLAN Tag Identifier for Receive Frames  This contains the 802.1Q VLAN tag to identify VLAN frames, and is compared to the fifteenth and sixteenth bytes of the frames being received for VLAN frames. Bits[15:13] are the User Priority, Bit[12] is the Canonical Format Indicator (CFI) and bits[11:0] are the VLAN tag's VLAN Identifier (VID) field. When the ETV bit is set, only the VID (Bits[11:0]) is used for comparison.  If VL (VL[11:0] if ETV is set) is all zeros, the MAC does not check the fifteenth and sixteenth bytes for VLAN tag comparison, and declares all frames with a Type field value of 0x8100 to be VLAN frames.</description>
